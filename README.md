### About:

##### Latitude/Longitude Coordinates via GPS Radio Signal

This application is developed in VB/NET

* This App uses a serial COM port peripheral interface to receive inputs from a USB GPS antenna.
* GPS radio signal messages are translated into ASCII/Char string sentence format.
* Various forms of timing and scheduling  are used to capture recorded and real-time data to end user.
* For the App Developer, this is a handy Skeleton Code-like kit.

##### Code Snipit Note: Durring development, I used the ["XAML Regions"](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3c534623-bb05-417f-afc0-c9e26bf0e177) plugin to help me keep track of my code. It is a small extension that adds the ability to define collapsable regions in XAML & XML code.
