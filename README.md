# Lat/Lon Coordinates via GPS Radio Signal

This application is developed in VB/NET

The code layout employed the "["XAML Regions"](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3c534623-bb05-417f-afc0-c9e26bf0e177
)" plugin. It is a small extension that adds the ability to define collapsable regions in XAML & XML code.

* This App uses a serial COM port peripheral interface to receive inputs from a USB GPS antenna.
* GPS radio signal messages are translated into ASCII/Char string sentence format.
* Various forms of timing and scheduling  are used to capture recorded and real-time data to end user.
* For the App Developer, this is a handy Skeleton Code-like kit.


[App Webpage](http://mezcel.wixsite.com/backyardgps), this webpage explains the background behind developing this DIY application.

## What to expect from this Application:

* Input GPS Radio Signal Location Information via a GPS antenna
* Select from a list of USB ports to receive your GPS antenna
* Reliable location calculations withing 1sec intervals
* View real time present location latitude and longitude
* View recent list of way-points reflecting where the end user last logged his/her present location
* Save way-point in a time stamped text file
* View a X-Y coordinate plane which shows a relative scale relationship to how far a person has moved from their start location
