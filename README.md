# Celestial Navagation Notes

### trial and error testing for a future html/.Net version of the app

Celestial navagation was used before satelite digital dopler effect triangulation

The 2-D paper triangulation process is more evident compared to the GPS process

I hope this becomes a nice backup to my existing system when I have bad GPS signals from (thick tree cannopy, cave, mountain, interference)

### JS and Html

I am using stanalone JS and Html file (mucho light weight)

It is faster than IDE since this hobby is more of a math calculation project vs. a programming project
