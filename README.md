# SVG Map (WIP)

## This element was a work in prgress brainstorm design (WIP)

### I am using a vector map image as a coordinate map with metadata

I am tweaking an SVG file xml in the stle of the SVG files generated by GPS Visualizer http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/

The mission here is to make something aesthetically relevant to the GPS vb.net app
